[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

Scripts and GUI for creating a prepopulated [Verdaccio](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio)-compatible npm cache.

## Why

Verdaccio is capable of acting as an npm server in offline environments (meaning absolutely no internet access).
However, you need to provide it with a cache of npm packages that it can serve.
This repository contains:

- Scripts for populating an npm cache and onloading the cache into a Verdaccio server
- Desktop programs to walk nontechnical users through that process
